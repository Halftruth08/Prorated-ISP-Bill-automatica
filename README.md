# Prorated-ISP-Bill-automatica
AKA REVENGE FOR TITLE 2
So, ISPs offer prorated bill credits when you suffer service outages. The catch is you have to call a 1-800 number to request the credit. The big idea here is that you might be able to automate the process of calling and requesting, nullifying the main barrier to everyone getting prorated bills (WHICH SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC).
The plan has four main parts:
use voice recognition to determine what data is being requested in the phone tree
fill a local protected location with the labelled voice recordings needed to verify the request (account number, etc.)
Use python and skype to make the call to the call center. 
Optimize the speed of responses through reducing the complexity of the listening needed to correctly trigger the next response.
Gather data on service outages 
Schedule the script to run once a month


If one person uses this script, NBD. If everyone uses it, there might be a lot of money in different peoples' hands.
